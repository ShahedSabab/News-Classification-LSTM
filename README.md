# Text-Classification-LSTM

The input data consist of 2225 news articles from the BBC news website corresponding to stories in 5 topical areas. LSTM has been applied in the classification task to categorize unknown data. <br/>

• TensorFlow 2.0, Keras has been used to train the model.<br/>
• Word embedding is used in feature generation.<br/>
• TSNE is used to visualize the word vectors in 2d space.<br/>
• L1 regularization is applied to prevent overfitting.<br/>
• 95% accuracy has been achieved.<br/>

# How to Run
